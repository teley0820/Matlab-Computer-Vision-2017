%PROGRAM: Color Segment
%DESCRIPTION: Takes a image, and separates it into two layers, a foreground
%and a background. The output is an image where the background is black and
%the foreground is a color chosen by the user. [3][4]
%This is the sample images I used.
lizard = imread('C:\Users\Tyler\Desktop\Assets for Lin Alg Report\Source Images\lizardbro.jpg'); %You will want to change the filepath to match your image
%This block of code contains variables that the user can change
imageToUse = lizard %This variable represents the image to use.
radius = 20 %As the value of radius increases, more of the image will be colored. Any pixels that are uncolored will be black.
red = 219; %This determines the red value of the images color
green = 15;%This determines the green value of the images color
blue = 15; %This determines the blue value of the images color
red = red/255
green = green/255
blue = blue/255
imageGrey = rgb2gray(imageToUse) %Converts the image to greyscale
j = 0;
background = imopen(imageGrey,strel('disk',radius));%The background is composed of several disks with a size equal to radius
figure
surf(double(background(1:8:end,1:8:end))),zlim([0 255]); set(gca,'ydir','reverse'); %The 3 lines above are used for preprocessing
image2 = imageGrey - background; %Subtracts the background from the image.
bwImage = imbinarize(image2);%Cleans up background. Without this, the program runs, however the background is partially colored as well
bwImage = bwareaopen(bwImage, 50);
rgbImage = cat(3, red*double(bwImage), green*double(bwImage), blue*double(bwImage));%Colors all white pixels the selected color
imshow(rgbImage) %Display Final Image
